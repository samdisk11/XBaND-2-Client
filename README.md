# XBaND-2-Client
 XBaND was a gaming hardware that you could put on your Sega Genisis or Super Nintendo, But after 4 years when it first came out it was discontiued.
 XBaND-2-Client is a revival and port of XBaND to the pc using VisualBasic 2017, and a few emulators like ZSNES to emulate the experince.
 You can visit the website of the revival at http://xband.freeiz.com/

# Note:
the XBaND open source client WILL crash as you will need to setup the settings.
